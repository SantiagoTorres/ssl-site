improved operation, but also to patch security flaws.
Unfortunately, the act of performing an update can itself be a
way to attack a computer, if a malicious update is installed. TUF is a
comprehensive, flexible framework to secure software updates even in situations
where the software repository is compromised. Developers can integrate TUF
into any software update system, or native programming language due to its
concise, self-contained architecture and specification. It offers both developers
and users protection from a host of potential attacks."

a crypto-currency (Cachecoin) in exchange for serving content to users.  Both cryptographic
and economic techniques demonstrate that, in CacheCash, these users are either forced or
economically incentivized to honestly serve content.  Our analysis
