improved operation, but also to patch security flaws.
Unfortunately, the act of performing an update can itself be a
way to attack a computer, if a malicious update is installed. TUF is a
comprehensive, flexible framework to secure software updates even in situations
where the software repository is compromised. Developers can integrate TUF
into any software update system, or native programming language due to its
concise, self-contained architecture and specification. It offers both developers
and users protection from a host of potential attacks."

    description: "Delivery of large chunks of content, such as video, accounts for a
substantial percentage of all Internet traffic.  This content is usually
served by provider networks that contract with Internet Service Providers.
CacheCash provides a similar content delivery service by having interested
users run caches of content.  These users are incentivized to participate by receiving
a crypto-currency (Cachecoin) in exchange for serving content to users.  Both cryptographic
and economic techniques demonstrate that, in CacheCash, these users are either forced or
economically incentivized to honestly serve content.  Our analysis
shows that CacheCash scales to meet the workload of even the most popular
services used today.  By building CacheCash, we intend to disrupt CDNs by
more readily and pervasively including end user served content."
