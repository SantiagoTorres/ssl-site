    description: "As networks and distributed systems grow more complex, there is a genuine need to better understand how they operate. The Seattle project is a software program and research platform, and supports an easy-to-access resource clearinghouse that supports both research and educational initiatives in these areas. Designed as a collaborative effort, all Seattle projects are run on resources—such as laptops, servers, and phones— donated by users and institutions. It currently serves updates to more than 40K geographically distributed devices around the world."
    products: "Our website contains information and links to educational modules, and a clearinghouse of available resources for those who wish to download and use the Seattle program, or to donate use of their devices for research purposes."

    description: "Given the close proximity of smartphones to users,
researchers would benefit from accessing smartphone sensors. By giving the user control over what amount and type of data gathered, Sensibility ensures the
privacy of user information.  Sensibility also has additional security
protections that ensure the safety of the device, while giving researchers
access to unique information."

    description: "A password database disclosure can be devastating, costing companies billions of dollars in damages. Polypasswordhasher offers a new approach to preventing such disclosure. By interrelating stored password data, potential hackers are forced to crack passwords in sets. This increases the attackers’ level of difficulty, making a PolyPasswordHasher-enabled database very hard to breach, even for an adversary with millions of computers."
    products: "Basic reference implementations of PPH have been written for Python, C, and Ruby. Easy to integrate libraries for different applications, including the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM), are used in a number of operating systems, including Linux and OS X. PPH is also used in the Seattle Clearinghouse and BioBank."
