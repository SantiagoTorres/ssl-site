intro: "Though all of SSL’s research initiatives—past and present— revolve

improved operation, but also to patch security flaws.
Unfortunately, the act of performing an updates can itself be a
way to attack a computer, if a malicious update is installed. TUF is a
comprehensive, flexible framework to secure software updates even in situations
where the software repository is compromised. Developers can integrate TUF
into any software update system, or native programming language due to its
concise, self-contained architecture and specification. It offers both developers
and users protection from a host of potential attacks."

approach to prevent an attacker from finding out which passwords are being used. By

PolyPasswordHasher-enabled database very hard to breach, even for an adversary
with millions of computers."

    description: "Delivery of large chunks of content, such as video, accounts for a
substantial percentage of all Internet traffic.  This content is usually
served by provider networks that contract with Internet Service Providers.
CacheCash provides a similar content delivery service by having interested
users run caches of content.  These users are incentivized by obtaining
a crypto-currency (CacheCash) for serving content to users.  Cryptographic
and economic techniques demonstrate that users are either forced or
economically incentivized to honestly serve content to users.  Our analysis
shows that CacheCash scales to meet the workload of even the most popular
services used today.  By building CacheCash, we intend to disrupt CDNs by
more readily and pervasively including end user served content."

    description: "Despite the best efforts of developers most program kernels contain flaws, and strategies to defend against triggering them have fallen short. Lind is a new virtual machine design that defends against these bugs by locking all system calls into popular access paths. The design is based on the idea that popular paths—ones used every day to access basic system requests—are much less likely to contain vulnerabilities. This limited kernel access reduces the possibility of interaction with flawed code."

By simulating the syscalls against a network model, syscalls that deviate from expected network semantics can be identified.
