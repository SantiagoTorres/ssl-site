intro: "Though all of SSL’s research initiatives—past and present— revolve around ensuring secure operation of computer systems, the specific areas addressed by the team vary greatly. Current initiatives can be grouped into five general categories."

    description: "The oldest of the lab’s projects, and the foundation technology behind several emerging initiatives, one of which is described below. Seattle is a platform for networking and distributed systems research that runs on resources—such as laptops, servers, and phones— donated by users and institutions. It currently serves updates to over 40K geographically distributed devices around the world."
    products: "Educational modules for classroom use designed to teach basic concepts in networking and system security; A clearinghouse of available resources to be accessed by users."

    description: "Given the close proximity of smartphones to users, 
researchers would benefit from accessing smartphone sensors. By giving the user control over what amount and type of data gathered, Sensibility ensures the 
privacy of user information.  Sensibility also has additional security 
protections that ensure the safety of the device, while giving researchers 
access to unique information."

    site: "https://polypasswordhasher.github.io/PolyPasswordHasher/"
    description: "is a secure password storage system that's highly resilient to offline password cracking. It achieves this resilience by
introducing asymmetry in the effort that servers require to verify
passwords, and crackers require to crack them."
    products: "Basic reference implementations of PPH  have been written for Python,  C,  and Ruby. A Django implementation that can be easily deployed is also in development. Research initiatives on PPH this summer have focused on providing easy to integrate libraries for different applications, including the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) and a Passport module. PAM is an authentication scheme used in a number of operating systems, including Linux and OS X, while the Passport module is authentication middleware that allows web users to store and authenticate their account with PPH by choosing “login with PPH”. Both modules can enable more applications to use PPH and increase the security of their password database exponentially in exchange for only modest adaptations to the OS or user behavior."
