    abstract: "Software update systems for automobiles can deliver significant
benefits, but, if not implemented carefully, they could potentially
incur serious security vulnerabilities. Previous solutions for securing
software updates consider standard attacks and deploy widely
understood security mechanisms, such as digital signatures for the
software updates, and hardware security modules (HSM) to sign
software updates. However, no existing solution considers more
advanced security objectives, such as resilience against a repository
compromise, or freeze attacks to the vehicle’s update mechanism,
or a compromise at a supplier’s site. Solutions developed
for the PC world do not generalize to automobiles for two reasons:
first, they do not solve problems that are unique to the automotive
industry (e.g., that there are many different types of computers
to be updated on a vehicle), and second, they do not address
security attacks that can cause a vehicle to fail (e.g. a man-in-the-middle
attack without compromising any signing key) or that can
cause a vehicle to become unsafe. In this paper, we present Uptane,
the first software update framework for automobiles that counters
a comprehensive array of security attacks, and is resilient to partial
compromises. Uptane adds strategic features to the state-of-the-art
software update framework, TUF, in order to address automotivespecific
vulnerabilities and limitations. Uptane is flexible and easy
to adopt, and its design details were developed together with the
main automotive industry stakeholders in the USA."

    title: "Diplomat: Using Delegations to Protect Community Repositories"
    link: "http://isis.poly.edu/~jcappos/papers/kuppusamy_nsdi_16.pdf"
    abstract: "Community repositories, such as Docker Hub, PyPI,
and RubyGems, are bustling marketplaces that distribute
software. Even though these repositories use common
software signing techniques (e.g., GPG and TLS), attackers
can still publish malicious packages after a server
compromise. This is mainly because a community repository
must have immediate access to signing keys in order
to certify the large number of new projects that are
registered each day. <br /> <br />
This work demonstrates that community repositories
can offer compromise-resilience and real-time project
registration by employing mechanisms that disambiguate
trust delegations. This is done through two delegation
mechanisms that provide flexibility in the amount of trust
assigned to different keys. Using this idea we implement
Diplomat, a software update framework that supports security
models with different security / usability tradeoffs.
By leveraging Diplomat, a community repository
can achieve near-perfect compromise-resilience while allowing
real-time project registration. For example, when
Diplomat is deployed and configured to maximize security
on s community repository, less than 1%
of users will be at risk even if an attacker controls the
repository and is undetected for a month. Diplomat is
being integrated by Ruby, CoreOS, Haskell, OCaml, and
Python, and has already been deployed by Flynn, LEAP,
and Docker."
