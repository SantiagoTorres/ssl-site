    title: "Diplomat: Using Delegations to Protect Community Repositories"
    link: "http://isis.poly.edu/~jcappos/papers/kuppusamy_nsdi_16.pdf"
    abstract: "Community repositories, such as Docker Hub, PyPI,
and RubyGems, are bustling marketplaces that distribute
software. Even though these repositories use common
software signing techniques (e.g., GPG and TLS), attackers
can still publish malicious packages after a server
compromise. This is mainly because a community repository
must have immediate access to signing keys in order
to certify the large number of new projects that are
registered each day. <br /> <br />
This work demonstrates that community repositories
can offer compromise-resilience and real-time project
registration by employing mechanisms that disambiguate
trust delegations. This is done through two delegation
mechanisms that provide flexibility in the amount of trust
assigned to different keys. Using this idea we implement
Diplomat, a software update framework that supports security
models with different security / usability tradeoffs.
By leveraging Diplomat, a community repository
can achieve near-perfect compromise-resilience while allowing
real-time project registration. For example, when
Diplomat is deployed and configured to maximize security
on s community repository, less than 1%
of users will be at risk even if an attacker controls the
repository and is undetected for a month. Diplomat is
being integrated by Ruby, CoreOS, Haskell, OCaml, and
Python, and has already been deployed by Flynn, LEAP,
and Docker."
