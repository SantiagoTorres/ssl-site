As computer-based technologies become more useful, entertaining, and pervasive, they also become more difficult to protect from attacks. The quick and extensive proliferation of such threats requires defense strategies that can be put in place NOW, and not a few years down the road. 

The Secure Systems Laboratory (SSL) at New York University, under the direction of Professor Justin Cappos, works to find practical and deployable solutions to real-world security threats that have the potential to impact computers, software, and smart devices. In its few short years of existence, it has developed products and improved on existing system designs that offer improved protection of personal information on smart devices, the early detection of exploitable flaws in software code, and the opportunity to securely conduct remote experiments. Technology developed by the lab is being utilized in a variety of settings, including community software repositories and open source software development initiatives. (NOTE: This last sentence is weak. I need more specific examples of current deployments to fix it.)

Lab researchers work with appropriate partners in industry, government agencies, as well as user communities, to tailor the products/processes/services developed to the specific needs of a given market. This will usually include a deployment, thus increasing the amount of time committed to far beyond that of a typical lab research project. Students and professionals associated with the lab tend to be interested in long-term commitments to lab initiatives, and many have seen projects through multiple stages of development.
