<h2 id="otherattacks">Other Attacks</h2>

<p> In addition to replay attacks, several other attacks on package managers 
have been identified.  Several popular package managers are vulnerable to an 
attacker who streams an endless quantity of data to them (an 
<A HREF="otherattacks.html#endlessdata">Endless Data</a> attack).   Package 
managers that sign packages instead of the repository metadata are vulnerable
to a number of metadata-based attacks including
<A HREF="otherattacks.html#extradep">Extraneous Dependencies</a>, 
<A HREF="otherattacks.html#unsatdep">Unsatisfiable Dependencies</a>, 
and <A HREF="otherattacks.html#provideseverything">Provides Everything</A>.   


<h2 id="endlessdata">Endless Data Attack</h2>

<p>
In an endless data attack, an attacker returns an endless stream of data to 
the client whenever files are requested (as previously described in 
<A HREF="http://insecure.org/stf/wietse_murphy.html">other work</A>).

<p>
Most package managers do not properly handle this type of attack.   The package
managers YUM and APT are used as examples to illustrate the problem, however
<b>this problem is not limited to YUM and APT</b>. 

<p>
When YUM is given a repository metadata file (repomd.xml) file 
of unlimited size, it exits silently after the filesystem is full with a 1 exit
code --- leaving the huge file on disk. Since no information is logged or 
printed about the error, this may make discovering the problem complicated 
(especially if YUM runs via auto-update).

<p>
APT is also vulnerable to this attack, but the size of the retrieved file is 
assumed to fit in a C unsigned long. This means that APT will willingly 
download up to 4 GB of data on 32 bit architectures for each file.  If APT is 
compiled on a 64 bit architecture, then it will happily try to download files 
greater than 18,000,000 TB!  Interestingly, APT could protect against this type of attack since the repository metadata is signed, known in advance to be small size, and provides the data sizes of the packages and other files to be downloaded. 

<p>
The endless data attack prevents clients from getting package updates from 
other repositories.  However, this attack also consumes large amounts of disk 
space on the client system as well as network bandwidth and CPU. Exhausting 
resources, especially disk space, on a client machine can have disastrous
effects. For example, on Fedora and Ubuntu this prevents logging, corrupts 
databases, and halts mail delivery.


<H4> How can I protect myself against this attack? </H4>

<p>
The effectiveness of this attack may be mitigated by using a separate 
filesystem for the cache directory used by the package manager. However, 
in some cases this attack also results in memory exhaustion (which is not
solved by having a separate partition).   It is worth noting that even if 
mitigation is successful, this attack 
still prevents updates from other package repositories from being installed.



<H2 id="extradep">Extraneous Dependencies</H2>

<p>
This attack only works on package managers that do not sign repository metadata.
This attack is launched by providing false dependency information for a package
the user will install. The false information says that one package also depends
on another that it actually doesn't depend on.
For example, an attacker can say that 
every package depends on some extraneous package of their choice.

<p>
This attack works on most modern package managers that do not sign repository
metadata. Surprisingly, they do 
not verify that the dependencies in the metadata of the <i>signed</i> packages they 
download match the <i>unsigned</i> package metadata they retrieve from the
repository!  The only restriction in the choice of extraneous package is that 
if package signatures are checked, then the extraneous package the attacker 
wants the client to install needs to be correctly signed.
Even when signatures are used, this attack can result in new,
vulnerable packages being installed.

<p>
Another way to use extraneous dependencies is to return package metadata that 
makes it look like a requested package has a huge number of package 
dependencies. In most package managers, all of these packages will be 
downloaded before any signatures are checked.

<p>
In addition to consuming disk and network resources on the client, this 
attack can be used by a malicious repository to launch an attack on other 
repositories. 
The malicious repository can advertise a new version of a package that depends on the entire set of core distribution packages, none of which are hosted by the malicious repository.
Assuming the client is configured to use multiple repositories, it will 
download all the distribution's packages from the other repositories.


<H4> How can I protect myself against this attack? </H4>

<p>
The easiest way is to use a package manager that signs the repository metadata
(like APT or YaST).   You could also manually do dependency resolution and
check signatures at the appropriate time, but that largely defeats the purpose
of having a package manager.



<H2 id="unsatdep">Unsatisfiable Dependencies</H2>

<p>
This attack only works on package managers that do not sign repository metadata.
An attacker can prevent installation of a package by returning metadata which
says the package has a dependency on a package that does not exist.
This prevents package managers from installing
the package, while to the user it appears that the repository or packager 
was in error rather than it being a suspected attack. 

<p>
Note that the attacker need not be able to correctly sign the package of 
interest. Since packages are not downloaded until after dependency resolution, 
the client will not download the package (or check the signature).

<H4> How can I protect myself against this attack? </H4>

<p>
The easiest way is to use a package manager that signs the repository metadata
(like APT or YaST).   You could also download the package and tell your package
manager to install the local copy.   Your package manager will check the 
signature and use the dependency information from the local copy.


<H2 id="provideseverything">Provides Everything</H2>

<p>
This attack only works on package managers that do not sign repository metadata.
Details of this attack are deferred to
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.arizona.edu/reports/2008/TR08-02.pdf">this paper</A>.
However, the result of this attack is that an attacker can cause a package
of their choice to be installed when it is unneeded by indicating it 
resolves dependencies in other packages.   This attack allows an attacker to
cause a malicious package on their repository to be installed when certain 
packages on other repositories are installed.


<H4> How can I protect myself against this attack? </H4>

<p>
Once again, using a package manager that signs the repository metadata
(like APT or YaST) solves this issue.
