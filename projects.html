  ##### Password Protection and Improved Network Security


<a name="cachecash"></a>
- **CacheCash**:  CacheCash presents a new design model for automated content delivery networks in which cryptocurrency payments are utilized to motivate participants to work honestly. Building on top of such a cryptocurrency, CacheCash creates an opportunity to construct a distributed, secure, and efficient incentivized content delivery system that does not depend upon a single entity to handle payments.

##### Secure Software Updates

<a name="tuf"></a>
- **The Update Framework (TUF)**: TUF provides a comprehensive, flexible security framework that developers can integrate with any software update system, or native programming language due to its concise, self-contained architecture and specification. It offers developers and users protection from a host of potential attacks through the use of images and signing strategies. https://theupdateframework.github.io/

  * Current deployments: Flynn, LEAP, and Docker software repositories

  * On-going integrations:  Repositories for Ruby, CoreOS, Haskell, OCaml, and Python’s PyPi

  * Lessons Learned:


<a name="uptane"></a>
- **[Uptane](https://uptane.github.io/)**: Cars today use a truly enormous 
amount of software.  Like any
software, this software has bugs.  Unfortunately there is not a secure way
to update the software in cars today.  Our Uptane project provides a 
mechanism to securely distribute updates to cars.  Uptane can counter a 
comprehensive array of security attacks, and is resilient to partial 
compromises, while addressing  automotive specific vulnerabilities and 
limitations. 

  * Products: [Our website](https://uptane.github.io/) contains high level
information about the project, including the 
[design specification](need link) and [deployment considerations](need link).
For those who want lower level details, we also provide a
[implementation guide](need link), an open source 
[reference implementation](need link), [compliance tests](need link), and 
a [runnable demo](need link).


  * Project members:  Trishank Kuppusamy, Sebastien Awwad, Akanitoro Brown,
Damon McCoy, Russ Bielawski (UMTRI), Cameron Mott (SWRI), Sam Lauzon (UMTRI),
André Weimerskirch (UMTRI), Justin Cappos.  **TODO: Need links **

  ##### Secure Software Development

<a name="in-toto"></a>
- **in-toto**: A program that holistically enforces the integrity of a software supply chain by gathering and signing information about the chain itself. Through the use of “link metadata,” in-toto provides documentation that ensures clear accountability as to how software is written, packaged and distributed...and by who.


  * Current deployments:

  * Lessons Learned:

<a name="lind"></a>
- **Lind**: a virtual machine design that prevents the triggering of kernel bugs by locking all system calls into popular access paths. The design is based on the idea that popular paths—ones used every day to access basic system requests—are much less likely to contain vulnerabilities. This limited kernel access reduces the possibility of interaction with flawed code.

  * Lessons Learned:

<a name="crashsimulator"></a>
- **CrashSimulator**: a tool that simulates “real-world” testing for new and upgraded software without the complications of “real-world” deployment. The program enables software developers to identify vulnerabilities in product designs long before they are packaged and released.

##### Understanding Code at the most Basic Level

<a name="atoms"></a>
- **Atoms of Confusion**: Within every confusing piece of software codes
  are small patterns that can lead developers  to outputs that radically
differ from what was intended. In studying these “atoms of confusion” we
look to build a firm empirical foundation for reducing code confusion in
software development and, thus, also reduce the frequency of buggy and
malfunctioning programs. 

  * Project members:  Dan Gopstein, Devon Powell, Jake Iannacone, Lois Anne
Delong, Apple Yan (PSU), Martin Yeh (PSU), Yanyan Zhuang (UCCS), Justin Cappos

  * Products:  The [project website](https://atomsofconfusion.com) provides
a rough background of our theory, studies, and analysis for this work.
We make all of our [study
materials and anonymized data](http://atomsofconfusion.com/experiments.html)
openly available so that other researchers can replicate, validate, and 
build on our findings.

<a name="blindspots"></a>
- **API Blindspots**: This project, a collaboration with researchers at the University of Florida, the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, and the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, seeks to identify security-related blind spots in Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

  ## Foundational Projects

These earlier lab projects are now completed and no new work on them is currently being done. However, these research initiatives remain important for a number of reasons. First, they set some parameters for the practical, problem-solving type of research the lab would do. And, in some cases, they pioneered approaches to particular security areas that continue to evolve into today’s products.

<a name="netcheck"></a>
- **NetCheck/CheckAPI**: NetCheck is a tool that can determine the cause of a failure in a networked application, without any application or network-specific knowledge, and without any modification to the application or its infrastructure. By treating an application as a blackbox, a diagnosis can be made using just a set of system call (syscall) invocation traces from the relevant end-hosts. By simulating the syscalls against a network model, syscalls that deviate from expected network semantics can be identified. In return, these deviations can be mapped to a diagnosis by using a set of heuristics.

  * Products: The source code for the NetCheck tool and all relevant documentation remain available at https://netcheck.poly.edu/projects/project/wiki.

<a name="upir"></a>
- **upPIR**: upPIR is a secure protocol by which a client can privately retrieve information from a set of mirrors. By packaging the required information with other data that potentially could be requested, the user's preference can be masked. In doing so, the privacy of the client is protected as the nature of the requested information can not be used to give away his sexual orientation, religious beliefs, political beliefs, or other sensitive data about the client and/or her company.
