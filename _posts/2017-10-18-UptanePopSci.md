We are excited to announce that the secure automotive software update
project <a href="/projects#uptane">Uptane</a> was selected as one of the 
top security innovations of 2017 by <a
href="https://www.popsci.com/top-security-innovations-2017#page-2>Popular
Science</a>.  Uptane is collaborative work with the University of Michigan 
Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI), and the Southwest Research 
Institute (SwRI), and is supported by contracts from the U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T).

Congratulations to all involved, especially Dr. Kuppusamy (aka Trishank) 
who recently defended his dissertation on Uptane!
