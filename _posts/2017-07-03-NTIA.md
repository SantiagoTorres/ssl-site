On May 11, President Trump issued an Executive Order to improve the
“cybersecurity of Federal networks and critical infrastructure.” The document
is a call to action to a number of Federal agencies, each of which is charged
with developing strategies and policies to better protect key government
networks, systems, and data resources from attack. In seeking out the best
strategies for addressing one identified vulnerability, “Resilience Against
Botnets and Other Automated, Distributed Threats,” the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) issued a “request for
comments” (RFC) on June 8.  The RFC invited all stakeholders, “including
private industry, academia, civil society, and other security experts”
to share “ways to improve industry's ability to reduce threats perpetuated
by automated distributed attacks, such as botnets, and what role, if any,
the U.S. Government should play in this area.”

As a group that has long advocated the role of secure software update strategies
in addressing these types of vulnerabilities, our lab viewed this RFC as a way
to evangelize for these strategies, particularly in the fast-growing area of the
Internet of Things (IoT). A response, primarily crafted by SSL summer intern
<a href="/people#shikhar_sakhuja">Shikhar Sakhuja</a>, was prepared over the
past few weeks to emphasize the need
for all IoT items to be securely updated to fix vulnerabilities—even those
currently deemed by their manufacturers as too inexpensive to warrant such
treatment. In doing so, the response emphasized that, without secure updates
to patch vulnerabilities, malware can be downloaded and signed like a regular
update. In turn, this malware can convert any smart device, even medical
equipment like defibrillators or imaging machines, into functional bots in a
botnet.

The response was built around three main points, which are listed below along
with a few quotes from the arguments used to support them.

* **NTIA should establish a Security Standard for Software Updates on IoT devices,
regardless of the manufacturer or brand of the product, as such a uniform
standard would establish a significant barrier for would-be attackers.**
Standardization can strengthen the security of IoT devices by removing the
argument that, since “many IoT devices are inexpensive, and likely to be
replaced after only a few years,” it would be “economically irrational” to
update them.  “Since software updates can be key in securing IoT devices and
preventing their use as bots in the next DDoS attack, such an investment
must be encouraged.”

* **NTIA should make compromise-resilience a mandatory component of the IoT update
security standards to protect vulnerable endpoints** Requiring compromise
resilience be built into any framework for updates  can ensure that, even
after a successful attack, “the least number of IoT devices are affected and
minimal damage can be inflicted upon the affected devices.” In addition, such a
framework can better deal with new vulnerabilities as they are discovered, as
well as, “fix system crippling bugs and combat malware.”

* **The NTIA and the Federal government have strong roles to play in establishing
an IOT consortium in which all the stakeholders in the IoT sphere can jointly
develop a compromise-resilient security update framework.** Here, the response
outlines a policy that SSL has pursued from the beginning: a commitment to
open source development, in which nothing is proprietary, and code and knowledge
is shared with the community so we can reach mutually-achieved solutions.
“We want to work with other stakeholders to design a compromise-resilient system
that would allow us to secure the chain of updates that could address security
bugs in IoTs, improve the devices’ performance, and defend the interconnected
web of devices that could redefine everything from manufacturing to medical
practices to the way we heat our water.”
