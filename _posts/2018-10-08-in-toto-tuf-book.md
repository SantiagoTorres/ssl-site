The potential role TUF and in-toto can play in container security has been
spotlighted in a new ebook from O'Reilly Media. "Operating Kubernetes Clusters
and Applications Safely," written by Liz Rice of Aqua Security and Michael
Hausenblas of Red Hat, addresses how to operate Kubernetes clusters and
generate container images securely. In describing  this secure cloud-native
ecosystem process, the authors acknowledge the way tools like in-toto and TUF
are poised to strengthen cloud-native pipelines and container image
deliveries.

The book can be  downloaded free of charge from the [aqua security
website](https://info.aquasec.com/kubernetes-security) simply by registering.
It's a very good read for people interested in securing their Kubernetes
deployments.
