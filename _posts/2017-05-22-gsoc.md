This summer we are giving back to the Python community.  I am excited to 
be working with Donald Stufft to mentor Pradyun Gedam, while he works on 
[dependency resolution for 
pip](https://gist.github.com/pradyunsg/5cf4a35b81f08b6432f280aba6f511eb).  
This should help Python users install packages in situations where there are
conflicts between dependencies of different packages.

Pradyun will doing this research work under the aegis of the Google Summer
of Code program. GSoC, as it is more commonly known, gives college student
programmers the opportunity to gain practical experience in open source
development, while receiving a stipend for their efforts. Pradyun will be
one of 1,318 GSoC students who will spend the summer working at one of 
201 mentoring organizations around the world.

Let the fun begin!
