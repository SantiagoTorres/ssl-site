This summer we are giving back to the Python community.  I am excited to 
be working with Donald Stufft to mentor Pradyun Gedam, while he works on 
[dependency resolution for 
pip](https://gist.github.com/pradyunsg/5cf4a35b81f08b6432f280aba6f511eb).  
This should help Python users install packages in situations where there are
conflicts between dependencies of different packages.

Let the fun begin!
