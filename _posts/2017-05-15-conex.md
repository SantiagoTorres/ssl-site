I spent this week with Hannes figuring out how best to secure
[Conex](https://hannes.nqsb.io/Posts/Conex), a TUF-like system for the 
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) community.  We spent quite a bit of time pouring 
over the Conex proposal and eventually concluded the best way to secure Conex 
was to leverage the delegation design from [TUF](projects/#tuf), but to add 
new functionality to support more complete decentralization.  


There were a lot of interesting observations from our discussions.

First, the TUF documentation really needs to be improved, especially when it
comes to roles.  I believe Conex's first design may have used TUF, if
we had clearer descriptions of how to set up the roles in a realistic
repository.  I believe that a more complete description about how different
real world TUF repositories are set up, will strengthen the paper and will
help with adoption.  This will be a point of emphasis in the coming weeks.  

Second, there are quite a few `underemphasized' design choices in TUF that
are important for security.  For example, we do not discuss clearly enough why
it is important to have a repository retrieve the timestamp metadata before
conveying any other information about the state of the client.  This is because
the repository is forced to say what set of snapshot metadata (and thus
all targets metadata) they will subsequently serve to the client.  This
prevents an attacker from learning the state of the repository to customize
their replay attack to the specific client's metadata state.

### Rotating keys

The final part was the discussion about how to do key rotation.  The model
for Conex / OCaml is to distribute trust as much as possible.  Hence there
is a desire to encourage delegations to a threshold of developer keys 
instead of to a project key, which may be centrally stored / stolen.
Hannes and I discussed and interesting way to let a role rotate
their keys without requiring the roles that delegate to it, to change their
delegation.  Effectively a key can sign a statement saying ``This key should
not be trusted anymore, instead use this new key''.  For example, foo's 
delegation to bar need not change for bar to rotate their key.

### Handling cycles of rotation
<img align="right" src="/img/TAP8_revoke_cycle.png" width="400"/>
One interesting side effect of this mechanism is how to handle a ``rotation
loop'', where a series of rotations create a cycle.  In this case, we believe
the sane behavior is for all of those keys to be treated as revoked, with
none of them trusted.  So, if bar rotates their keys back to a previous key,
then all keys in the cycle or that rotate to the cycle are treated as invalid.

### Explicitly revoking one's own key
<img align="left" src="/img/TAP8_revoke_one.png" width="200"/>
The nice feature of this is that a role now has an easy way to revoke trust 
in their key.  The role simply rotates the key to itself (creating a cycle
of one).  This effectively states, do not trust my key for any signatures in
the future.  This can be used to let a user revoke trust in their key without
requiring the parties that delegate to them to be involved.  


### Rotation beyond targets roles?
This rotation primitive is also being considered for non-targets 
roles.  Docker's security team expressed strong interest about 6 months ago in key 
rotation for the timestamp role.  We are eager to work with them to ensure 
this proposal meets their needs / goals.  This primitive would likely replace
the root rotation mechanism, preventing users from downloading all missing root
metadata (whether the root keys changed or not).  It also would allow the
root roles on a repository to sign a statement revoking trust in themselves,
in case a threshold of root keys were compromised.  This would mean that 
any client that can connect to retrieve this metadata, would stop trusting
that repository in the future.

In closing, we are excited to continue this discussion via 
[TAP 8](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/blob/tap8/tap8.md).  We
are working together to get TUF's security deployed for the OCaml community 
moving forward!
