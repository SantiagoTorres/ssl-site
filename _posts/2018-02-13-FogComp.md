There is no doubt that cloud computing is here to stay. A year ago, a study by
[Gartner](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3616417), a prominent research
firm, estimated an 18% growth in worldwide revenue from the technology, to a total of $246.8 billion.
In the light of this growth, it is perhaps not surprising that variations of cloud computing have already been introduced. Fog Computing replaces the centralized nature of the cloud with distributed units that
can do all the necessary computation in a data hub on a smart device,
or in a smart router or gateway. Designed primarily to support the growing
computing needs of smart devices on the Internet of Things (IoT), its name
comes from the idea that fog architecture “brings the cloud down to the
ground.” By closing the gap between where data is created and where it is
acted upon, fog computing systems can perform tasks faster and more
efficiently, as it eliminates the need to send everything to the cloud
for processing.

Though the term "fog computing" has been commonly used only in the past two or three years,the ideas have been when the National
Institute of Standards and Technology published a document of accepted
definitions, characteristics, acronyms and abbreviations.The brief report,
called simply “The NIST Definition of Fog Computing,” sets out to provide
“clear distinction” between “fog computing and its subsidiary, mist computing,”
and related concepts such as cloud computing, cloudlets and edge computing.”
(Note: the final report must be purchased, but a draft from before the comment
period is available at https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/sp/800-191/draft/documents/sp800-191-draft.pdf.)  

Better categorization of the technologies will likely become more crucial as
the usage of IoT continues to accelerate. The Gartner firm estimates that in
just two years time, there will be more than
[20 billion such devices](http://www.zdnet.com/article/iot-devices-will-outnumber-the-worlds-population-this-year-for-the-first-time/).
The flexibility and distributed nature of fog computing offers great promise in
supporting that growth.

Yet, as the potential for fog technology is vast, so are the challenges. The rapidly expanding variety of smart devices
— everything from wearable fitness trackers, to wireless sensor networks — means that fog computing strategies will
have to workin a number of unique scenarios. [Yi et al.](http://www.cs.wm.edu/~syi/publications/mobidata15_1.pdf)
note that the variety of resources that can act as servers in a fog system range 
from “resource-poor devices such as set-top boxes, access points, routers, switches, base stations, and end devices,
or resource-rich machines such as Cloudlet...a ‘cloud in a box’ available for use by nearby mobile devices.”  
Observing that some IoT devices may consist of only a sensor and the cloud,
[Bellavista and Zanni](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3010000/3007777/a16-Bellavista.pdf?ip=216.165.95.189&id=3007777&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=36E5A5D4E382B3FA%2E36E5A5D4E382B3FA%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&__acm__=1518562754_e09c9234a7e45d3705b88ca756edd595) caution that in many cases, the architecture of these devices may be inadequate for fog applications. In addition, they mention that “connectivity costs are not negligible in several business cases.”	
		
Researchers at SSL have begun to investigate these challenges. In doing so, the lab taps almost a decade of experience
in solving problems in cloud computing through its Seattle Testbed. Seattle enables researchers to securely run 
code on a variety of device (laptops, tablets, smartphones) with computational use and storage donated
by universities and individuals. 

In a [paper](https://github.com/aaaaalbert/fogwc/raw/SUBMITTED/paper.pdf)
presented by SSL research professor Albert Rafetseder at the inaugural Fog World
Congress last November, the authors point to some of the ways Seattle can
facilitate fog processing for IoT devices. First, the “loose coupling and
precise trust boundaries” of Seattle’s components enable “deployments with
minimal mutual trust requirements,” and allow new infrastructure components
to be “introduced freely to replace or augment existing ones, as long as
the component interfaces are adhered to.” This supports the distributed nature
of fog systems. Second, Seattle is already running on a variety of heterogeneous
nodes, or alternative platforms, such as Android devices, resource-limited
structures like Raspberry Pis, or routers and embedded devices running OpenWrt.
This addresses the concerns raised above.

Most importantly, the authors — Rafetseder, Lukas Pühringer, and Justin Cappos —
cite Seattle’s proven track record in protecting the safety of host devices and
the security of any data on them as a plus for its use in fog computing
applications. Seattle’s [sandboxed environment](https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v2/blob/master/README.md),
which isolates code run on the devices from other applications and data,
also imposes strict usage quotas for all resources of the hosting system,
including Central Processing Unit (CPU) time and memory, used disk space,
and even IP addresses and port numbers on network interfaces. And, from a
security standpoint, isolation keeps buggy or deliberately destructive code
from harming the host machine.

Since fog computing is still in its infancy, it may be too soon to predict
what components or systems will ultimately become standard. In a conversation
conducted shortly before the paper was presented, Rafetseder described the
“uncertainty” attached to the Fog concept.  “We don't know if it will be widely
deployed, what deployments will actually look like, or what companies and use
cases there will be. However, we know from experience with Seattle that our
architecture is quite well prepared for whatever shape the landscape will turn out to take.”
