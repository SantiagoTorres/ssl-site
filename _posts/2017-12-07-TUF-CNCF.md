A few months ago, TUF was adopted by the Linux Foundation's [Cloud Native
Computing Foundation](https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/24/the-cloud-native-computing-foundation-adds-two-security-projects-to-its-open-source-stable/).
The CNCF provides a more formal foundation structure to the project and 
has encouraged us to participate in positive efforts such as working toward CII
badging.  There is also the potential for substantially more adoption as the 
CNCF pushes for more use of TUF by different teams.  We are looking forward to
working toward this.

We had a meeting today with attendees interested in TUF and Notary to help
new contributors get started with the project.  Most of the discussion was 
around a few of the [TAPs](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps), in 
particular [Multiple repository support (TAP 
4)](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/blob/master/tap4.md), support
for [setting URLs for roles in the root metadata file (TAP 
5)](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/blob/master/tap5.md), and
[key rotation / self-revocation of 
keys](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/blob/master/tap8.md).
We also had a broader discussion around the use of the custom metadata field
for TUF targets, which David Lawrence mentioned a neat use case for.  I am 
really happy about all of the positive effort and attention that the project 
is getting!  <img align="right" src="/img/TUF-shirts-LR.jpg" width="150" style="margin: 0px 20px"/>

However, there are some other things we did not expect.  There was TUF 
merchandise for sale at the conference, including hoodies and T-shirts.
There also was an ice sculpture of the TUF logo on display at an event last
night.  A very interesting way to promote the project!
