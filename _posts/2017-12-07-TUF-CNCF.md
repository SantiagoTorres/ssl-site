A few months ago, TUF was adopted by the Linux Foundation's [Cloud Native
Computing Foundation]](https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/24/the-cloud-native-computing-foundation-adds-two-security-projects-to-its-open-source-stable/).
The CNCF provides a more formal foundation structure to the project and 
has encouraged us to participate in positive efforts such as working toward CII
badging.  There is also the potential for substantially more adoption as the 
CNCF pushes for more use of TUF by different teams.  We are looking forward to
working toward this.

We had a meeting today with attendees interested in TUF and Notary to help
new contributors get started with the project.  I am really happy about all of
the positive effort and attention that the project is getting!

However, there are some other things we did not expect.  There was TUF 
merchandise for sale at the conference, including hoodies and T-shirts.
There also was an ice sculpture of the TUF logo on display at an event last
night.  A very interesting way to promote the project!
